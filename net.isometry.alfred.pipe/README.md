# pipe workflow by isometry

A workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to transform the currently selected text or the contents of the clipboard by passing it through an arbitrary shell one-liner.

## Requirements

- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (version 2.0+)
- The [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).
- [pipe.alfredworkflow](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/pipe.alfredworkflow)

## Usage

(Optional) assign hotkeys for the two Hotkey handlers in the workflow. I recommend `Cmd+Shift+|` and `Cmd+Ctrl+\`, respectively.

Two actions are available, both taking an arbitrarily complex shell pipe as their argument:

1. triggered by the first hotkey or by the `|` or `pipe` keywords, will transform the clipboard in-place by passing its contents through the pipe given as argument.
2. triggered by the second hotkey, will transform the currently selected text in-place by passing its contents through the pipe given as argument.

A number of built-in pipelines are [included](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/net.isometry.alfred.pipe/builtins.json), and custom aliases can also be defined with the following syntax:

`| alias NAME=PIPE | LINE@@`

`| alias tac=sed '1!G;h;$!d'@@`

You can delete custom aliases by actioning on them while holding the `alt` key.
